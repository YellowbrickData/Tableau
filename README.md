https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tree/master/samples/plugins/postgres_odbc


Only the yellowbrick-x.x.x.taco file is needed to install the Yellowbrick Tableau connector.  All other files are for packaging the connector itself. 

INSTALLATION:
Copy the yellowbrick-x.x.x.taco file to your C:\Users\<userid>\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Connectors and restart Tableau Desktop.  The "Yellowbrick by Yellowbrick Data" connector should appear in the list of servers when you connect to a new data source.  Taco files are only supported in Tableau 2019.4 and later.
